# SUCCOTASH
This is a small collaborative project I made with my friend. It uses [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib). It is fully cross-platform.

## Dependencies
Cmake, Git.
Also it is recommended that you use gcc compiler, but it should work with other ones.

## How to build
- clone the repo using this command:
`git clone https://github.com/enaki6/succotash.git`

- move to the project root directory using your terminal of choice and enter following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
The executable should be at the build directory or the debug directory.
